# Simple Java Servlets API Demo
This repository contains a small Java project demonstrating the usage of Servlets to create simple GET and POST APIs. Throughout the development process, the project explores the concepts of Servlets, Dependency Injection, and the significance of the pom.xml file.

## Servlets Overview
Servlets are Java classes that handle HTTP requests and responses. In this project, we have implemented two Servlets: GetServlet for handling GET requests and PostServlet for handling POST requests. These Servlets are configured in the web.xml file.

## Dependency Injection
The project explores the concept of Dependency Injection, a design pattern that promotes loose coupling by injecting dependencies into an object rather than allowing the object to create its dependencies. This improves testability and maintainability.
